# Newton-Interpolations---MATLAB
Newton Forward and Backward Interpolations using MATLAB

## What is this?
This repository contains two MATLAB programs/codes for:
1. Newton Forward Interpolation
2. Newton Backward Interpolation

## Story
In my Numerical Analysis class, we (me + other students) have been assigned to write a program for these two methods. I tried searching Google for a pre-made program. But... I did not find any.

Yes, I had found few programs for Newton Forward Interpolation but they were hard to understand and were for fixed number of values.

I failed to cheat. :P

Then, I decided to use my own brain to write the code and the result is here. (Yes, I'm a lazy programmer.)

So, these programs just works. I've tested with 3 questions and the results matches the answers, almost.

But it may contain several bugs and may not work sometime. Anything can happen.

If you are using these programs, don't. Try to make your own. This is how you learn.

But if you are lazy like me, go ahead and copy-paste but at your own responsibility. This is for educational pupose only.

## Support
No support dude.

If you have found a bug, try to resolve yourself. If succeeded, make a pull request and I'll be happy to merge your changes.

Have a nice day and wonderful dreams at night!
